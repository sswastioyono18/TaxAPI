# Getting Started

### Tax API Project
In my current workplace, we have so many classes using different tax project. Some classes use util, another class use property file directly.
Our objective is to create a mini api that return current tax for all the application

Currently, this is the feature
- endpoint /getTax for retrieving current tax
- endpoint /updateTax for updating the tax rate (if needed, maybe look dangerous)
- TBD : feature toggle (such as after specific date and time, tax rate will use new one)
- TBD : using HTTPS for more security
- TBD : load/performance test
